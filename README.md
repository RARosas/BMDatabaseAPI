# BMDatabaseAPI
This API works with a DAO pattern to acces all the data in the users table inside the database. 
It works with glassfish server 5 to start and manage the different request to the database.
In this project you can find all the methods to read, add, edit or delete any item in the database.

In the next versions i'm going to include stock and sales as other tables to manage with the API, simulating the most common inputs and outputs of data inside any business.
